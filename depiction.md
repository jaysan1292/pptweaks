Tweaks a number of things in NimbleBit's Pocket Planes.<br>
Make sure to check Settings to configure!

----------

**What it does**

- Remove the labels above each plane in the Map view. Does not affect the view for planes the player is sending out.
- Change the time display to have more descriptive labels (i.e., 10s, 20s, 30s)
- Move the tweet button in the flight view to somewhere it won't be accidentally tapped
- Disables the plane notification dropdown, and plays an alert sound instead
- Sort the event list by progress made, in descending order
- Show the dots for owned airports at every zoom level. When planning a flight, only cities that the plane is able to land on will be shown, and are in range. The destination airport is also shown.
- When sending out a plane, all other planes are hidden.
- When planning a trip, don't show any other planes, and don't scale anything.
- Planes on the Map view are scaled according to the zoom level
- If a city is closed, then make its dot semi-transparent
- Play a sound when new jobs come in
- Planes are sorted when going from plane-to-plane using the side arrows or swiping (easier seen than explained)
- If a job is a global event job, move it to the top of the jobs list
